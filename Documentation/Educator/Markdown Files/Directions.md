## Space:
A place where the student is placed above the solar system. They can view the solar system as the celestial bodies rotate on their axis and the planets revolve around the sun. Each planet is selectable from the point of view of the student. Selecting a celestial body will take them to a singled out view where they get a close up with that celestial body. There is a facts board around the student where they can read interesting facts and information regarding each body relating to the SOL and some extra cool facts thrown in.

There is a back button to return from the individual view of any one celestial body which will bring the student back to the solar system view. There is also a Home button from within the solar system view to return back to the main menu.

## Music:
A place where the student is placed in an auditorium, able to view and learn about different musical instruments. They are auditorially quizzed for fun on the different instruments giving students the opportunity to hear the instruments in a way where they otherwise wouldn't be able to. There is also a screen where the students can individually inspect each of the instruments and read facts about them.

There is always a back button for each scene taking the student to the previous scene. This allows the student to exit at any time.
