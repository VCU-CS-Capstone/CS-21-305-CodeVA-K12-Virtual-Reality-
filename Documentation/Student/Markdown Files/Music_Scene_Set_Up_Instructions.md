# Directions for Music Scene Set Up

## __NOTICE: This section assumes you have fully completed the General Setup and All Space Instructions.__

## Getting Started

After completing the General Set Up Instructions and the Space scene, you should have a general idea of how Unity works. </br>
We will now move forward to creating the Music scene, which provides a few extra challenges.

To begin, we must acquire all assets required from the Unity Asset Store. For our case, it is better to use premade assets as creating these ourselves would be another project in itself.

Assets Used: 
- [Auditorium](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/auditorium-141127) : All Auditorium Assets
- [Instruments](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/stylized-musical-instruments-pack-176502) : All instrument prefabs

Download and import these assets into Unity. If you have problems during importation, consult Unity documentation online.

<i>NOTE: These assets are not free. If free assets are needed, explore the Unity Asset Store and find suitable alternatives. </br>
The Auditorium asset is simply an environment to use; any free environment will work fine. </br>
The instruments were the most concise pack we could find; free instruments will work here as well. </br> </i>

## Seting Up the Environment

We will now set up the Auditorium Environment. If you used a different environment, tailor all instructions to fit your assets as best as possible. This leaves you room for creativity.
