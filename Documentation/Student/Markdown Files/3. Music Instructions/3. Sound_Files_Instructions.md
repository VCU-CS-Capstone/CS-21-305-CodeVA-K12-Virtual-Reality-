# Directions for Music Scene Sound Creation

## Getting Started

After setting up the Music Spawner and getting the 3D models on stage, you can create and attach the .wav sound files to them. </br>

For the sound files, we used Noteflight to create scores for each instrument.

Resources Used: 
- [Noteflight](www.noteflight.com)

After making an account, you will be able to create a score.

## Creating the Scores

To showcase each instrument's sound, use a simple arpeggio.  Use notes in the following pattern. </br>

<em>Arpeggio</em> means a series of notes played in succession, either ascending or descending. </br>

For each instrument, you can switch the sound by editing the parts.

There are many instruments to choose from.  Pick the ones that match our assets.  Each one will need to be exported and attached separately.

When you are ready to export, select the export button, indicated with a cloud icon and a down arrow.  Make sure to select a .wav file.
