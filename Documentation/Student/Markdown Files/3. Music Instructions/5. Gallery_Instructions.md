# Directions for Gallery Scene

## __NOTICE: This section assumes you have fully completed the General Setup, all Space Instructions and all prior Music instructions.__

## Getting Started
This is the last scene we need to work on for the music project. These instructions will open-ended guidelines; however, most of this scene's technical details will be left as a challenge for you.

### Creating the spawner
1. You will start by creating a spawner just like you do for the Finite scene creation. The only difference this time is that you will only have one spawn location in the middle of the stage as we will only spawn one instrument at a time.
2. Position your spawner in such a way that is far enough away to still be on the stage but close enough to see the instrument clearly. <i>HINT: You can drag some of the instrument prefabs into the scene and change their position to find what position looks best to you. You will then delete these prefabs from the scene afterwards and use the position values you liked for them for your spawner.</i> </br>

Code will be added to this object later in these instructions.

### Adding (Editing) the buttons
3. Copy and paste in the MusicMainMenuButtonDrop game object and all children into this scene from the Finite game scene. Delete the following children of the MusicMainMenuButtonDrop game object: ScoreText, PanelGreatWork, and ButtonRestart. 
4. Rename the Left button to Previous Button, the Middle Button to Play Sound Button, and the Right Button to Next Button.
5. Change the position and text content of the Previous, Play Sound, and Next buttons to match how they look in our game.
An example of how our buttons are positioned is shown below:
