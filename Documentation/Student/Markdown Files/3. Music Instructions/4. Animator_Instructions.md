# Directions for Animator Set Up

## __NOTICE: This section assumes you have fully completed all previous instructions.__

## Getting Started

Whether you chose to use an animator in your project or not is up to you. In our project, animators controlled the lowering and raising of main menu buttons, fading in and out of buttons, and fading in and out of UI elements. The project will still work correctly without these buttons movements and transitions; however, an animator can make a project much cleaner and more streamlined.

In the music spawner instructions, you may have noticed that we created a reference to an animator and had it be triggered by the Clear() method. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create this animator and animation, along with the raising and lowering of the main menu buttons. How you chose to handle the main menu is up to you. If you want it to work like ours with the buttons attached to the rope, simply place the buttons where you want their lowered place to be and place several rope objects behind them to give the look of it being held by the rope. Place all elements you want to move under a single parent game object with a fitting name, such as ButtonsAndRope, so that you can control the movement of all elements at once. For creation of the rope, try searching "how to create a rope in blender" in YouTube and you will find multiple tutorials on the subject. All of the creation of the initial Main Menu will be done in the Music Main Menu Scene; however, the animtor logic will be applied to all scenes. The buttons created for the Music Main Menu scene will only have the function of switching to the scenes indicated by the button.

### Creating the animator

Once you have decided how you want your main menu to look, you can add an animator to it to control movement. Like you did in the space scene and create a new animator, name it whatever you like, and attach it as a component to the previously created MusicMainMenuDrop game object. Ours will be refered to as MusicMainMenuDrop. 

<i><b>NOTE:</b> All elements you want to be controlled by the animator must be a child of the game object that you attached the animator to.</i>

1. With the new animator created, create an animation named MusicMenuDrop. The will be the animation that is played at the start of each music scene. You can use this same animation in all scenes and it will only change the elements added that exist in the current scene. For this animator to work properly, multiple elements will be controlled and initialized. The first thing you will do is ensure you are at the 0 second mark of the animator and start recording.
2. While recording, set the location of where you want the raised place of the menu to be and ensure that it is recorded in the animation window. Then move to the 10 second mark and set the location of the final lowered menu. If you stop recording and play the animation at this time, you should be able to see the menu slowly drop down. Ensure that your animation is not set to loop.
3. For the Music Main Menu scene, that is all that is needed for this animation. However, we need this animation to work across all scenes so we have to make sure it covers all necessary elements to initialize each scene. Copy the ButtonsAndRope game object and paste it as a child of the StageButtonsCanvas object. Make sure that you attach the animator to the MusicMainMenuDrop object in this scene as well. Edit the buttons to say and read what you like. Do not change the name of the ButtonsAndRope object or the animator will not work anymore. You can use a panel rather than a button to state the instructions for the game. Play the game at this point should have the menu lowering to the proper place as expected. However, you will noticed that the scene appears very cluttered as the UI is visible at all times and the left, right, and middle buttons are always in the scene. We can use the animator to intitial these elements in the scene so that they are not always visible.
