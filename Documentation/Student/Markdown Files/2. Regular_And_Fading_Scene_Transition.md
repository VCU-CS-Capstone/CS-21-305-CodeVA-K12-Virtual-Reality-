### Instructions ###
Naviagate to the HelloCardboard scene with details from the Basic UI Creation instructions in place
#### Simple Scene Transition ####
1. With the HelloCardboard scene open, right click in the hierarchy and create an empty game object. This will be used to hold the script required to change scenes;
therefore, you should give it a name that will indicate its purpose. For example, SceneChangerScript. The position of the object does not matter as it is not a visual element.
2. In the inspector of the SceneChangerScript game object, click Add Component and select New Script from the menu. Give the script a fitting name such as ClickSwitchScenes,
then click Create and Add. 
3. Double click on the script in the inspector. This will open up the code for you to edit. Delete the default start() and update() methods as they are needed for scene transition.
