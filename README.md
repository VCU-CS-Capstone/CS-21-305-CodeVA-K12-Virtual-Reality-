## *Description*
To address the issue of broadening participation in computer science, computer science experiences in the classroom must be authentic and engaging. Although many students spend a lot of time gaming outside of school, there is often little connection between the programming they learn at school and existing cutting edge technologies in industry. More schools are gaining access to VR headsets, but many teachers do not have the skills to integrate the hardware into their curricula. VR programming can be applied across content areas to make History, English, Art, Music, and even Mathematics more of an immersive experience.
