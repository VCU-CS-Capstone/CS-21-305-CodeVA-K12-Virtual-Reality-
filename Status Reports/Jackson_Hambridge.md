## Week Seven

### What have you done?
- Met with Mr. Shank
- Began developing elliptical orbit
### What are you working on in the upcoming week?
- Create a script for elliptical orbit
- Give each planet a correctly proportional time for a complete rotation around the sun
### Questions & Issues
- Nothing at the moment!

## Week Eight

### What have you done?
- Met with Mr. Shank
- Created custom code for elliptical orbit
- Assembled Google Carboard headset
- Adjusted revolution speed of planets
### What are you working on in the upcoming week?
- Set the planets on the correct elliptical path
- Fix the rotation of each planet to make them proportional to each other
### Questions & Issues
- Nothing at the moment!

## Week Nine

### What have you done?
- Modified planet rotation speed
- Updated elliptical orbits where necessary
### What are you working on in the upcoming week?
- Push new changes
- Add Pluto’s rotation and revolution speed
- Gather planetary facts for next stage of the program with Jacob
### Questions & Issues:
- Nothing at the moment!

## Week Ten

### What have you done?
- Met with Mr. Shank
- Created a pull request with new changes
- Collected planetary facts, such as diameter, distance from the sun, gravitational constant, and additionally fun facts about each planet.
- Added facts to Jacob's document
### What are you working on in the upcoming week?
- Create new branch with all new changes from dev
- Apply proportional rotational and revolution speeds with new features
- Conclude the fact finding with Jacob
### Questions & Issues:
- There's a difference between a day and a full rotation on some planets. I'm doing more research into which is more practical for the proportional speed, because those numbers can be drastically different in some cases.

## Week Eleven

### What have you done?
- Met with Mr. Shank
- Merged revolution and rotation speeds to dev
- Updated each individual scene for each planet to fix rotational speed
